## **2) Abstract**
For this project, I will examine the covers of Vogue Magazine over the past ten years from all 17 countries that it is published in including: Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and United States. The data will consist of the text content featured on the cover. Using this data, a topic model will be created that highlights the key topics from each country over time. This will allow for analysis of the content per country, as well as over time. 

The purpose of the project is to provide an outline of the key topics discussed in Vogue Magazine over time. Being a well known fashion magazine, Vogue reaches a massive audience across the world. This topic model will help the public understand the cultural, societal, and beauty standards across 17 countries. The project will also provide insight into the consumer language used to entice women to purchase the product. I predict that across the world we will see different popular standards for women relating to sex, relationships, beauty and physique. I predict there will be altering levels of these topics based on the countries cultural values. 

An important component of this project will be creating a website entirely open to the public. This will allow for the general public to gain further knowledge regarding societal pressures on women. Additionally, scholars will be able to access the data to further contribute to their research and studies. There are a number of potential studies that could derive from this data set including: psychological studies, consumer advertising studies, as well as further digital humanities studies. 

## **3) Narrative**

**Inhancing the Humanities**

The overall goal of this project is to create a functional topic model that identifies prominent topics from Vogue Magazine over 10 years. With this project will we be able to identify the beauty standards across the world in order to better understand the cultural and societal pressures on women. By using the text on the magazine covers, we can identify the topics within these phrases that the industry is using to draw consumers to their product; as well as, identify the ideas that Vogue believes are most appealing to their audience. 

Why is this important? Over the past 10 years there as been an intense increase in mental health problems among young women. These illnesses have included depression, anxiety as well as eating disorders. Many physiologists and scholars in the humanities attribute this to the increase in digital media, and the consumer culture we live in today. Although some studies have been done, they are not conclusive as the data has not been examined as a whole. I want to create this database in order to gather all of this information into one location to provide a concrete analysis.	

The first steps of this project will be to gather all of these covers. There are a number of online resources, as well as libraries that hold a vast collection of Vogue, it will just be a matter of compiling this information. This could be a goal of the class from the University of Richmond that this project is planning on working with. Following data collection, Mallet will be used to create a visual topic model of the information. 

Upon completing the research and topic modeling aspect of this project, the data will be thoroughly analyzed. A website will be used to host the data and analysis. The data will be displayed in interactive timelines from each country throughout time. Viewers will be able to interact with the topic model by selecting topics that reveal additional images of a specific cover. The website will be entirely open to the public, so that more people can understand and benefit from this project. 

Using this website, scholars can conduct further studies in order to truly pin point exactly what is having a negative effect on young women. With the results, there can be a concrete topic or ideal that we can identify as negatively effecting young women. Once this is known and proven, it will be significantly easier to change the industry. Rather than just saying, “Hey you shouldn’t do that,” we can conclude that the industry should not participate in including certain ideals because they are harmful for X reason that comes out of the topic model. 

This topic model will allow scholars access to more data to complete further research. Students will benefit from the learning experience of creating the topic model, as well as using the results to analyze information and indicate where change needs to be made. This topic model as it will be easily accessible to the public, and well explained in the website so that they may understand the standards employed by Vogue Magazine. 

The digital humanities questions that will be addressed in this project are:

+ How are beauty standards represented in text?
+ How do these standards vary per country?
+ What do these beauty standards say about society around the world?
+ How do these standards effect the population?

These questions will help further the media studies discipline within humanities. Media studies is defined as “the study of newspapers, magazines, advertising, etc. and their influence on society as an educational subject”. This project will help further media studies as it will examine the ideals and standards behind the content. With this topic model we will be able to understand what society deems as important through the covers of the magazines.

As I stated before, the project will be a topic model made through Mallet. A topic model is a computer-generated document that suggests themes and ideas that appear from co-ocurance which is how often certain words appear next to each other. For this model, 50 topics will be used. This is because there are not many words on the cover of the magazine, so 50 will allow for analysis without making it too large. This will create a topic model that provides an accurate representation of the topics covered on the covers. In addition, the topic model will include a timeline so the data will evolve year to year, helping identify the most prominent topics per year.  
	
**Environmental Scan**

A similar project done at Yale University created a topic model of all articles ever published in Vogue from 1892-2013 called Robots Reading Vogue. This project produced a lot of data with topics ranging from dressmaking to politics.  While this was an effective and interesting topic model, I think that the data corpus used is almost too big to really be able to get into general themes. With my project, there will be less topics thus there will hopefully be more concise themes that come out of the topic model. This will allow for further specific analysis instead of dealing with all this data. 

Similarly to the Yale project, once finished this project will be put online. This site will include images of the topic models, also similar to the other project. However, it will also included a detailed analysis. The analysis will identify general trends, beauty standards and societal norms presented as the humanities questions. This will allow for the information to be more comprehensive to the general public. Further research to be conducted quickly with no hoops to jump through for other researchers. Some future projects based off this one could include a psychology focused project on the effects of the topics generated on young women, and how the industry could be positively changed. 

**History of the Project**

The idea for this project was conceived out of a need for more conclusive and public data regarding magazines effects on young women. After viewing a few projects including, Robots Reading Vogue, it was obvious that while there is interest in this topic, there is not much clear data. The algorithm used for most of Robots Reading Vogue had noticeable problems which tainted the data. The data that is accessible does not offer any answers to humanities questions, rather just an image of the data collected. Thus, this project will not only create data, but it will also apply the information in an analysis so it can be understood by the public. In order for this project to be meaningful, there needs to be more context than what has been provided in earlier projects. 

While the data collecting has not yet started for this project, there are many preliminary aspects that have begun. As stated earlier, this project will partner with the University of Richmond for the facilities needed to complete the data. We have created a group of students who are interested in collecting and analyzing data for this project. They will do this for internship college credit, thus they do not need to be paid. Additionally, while making this a class at the university the facilities will not need to be paid for by the project. Therefore, we can use the money granted to other aspects of the project like hiring experts to help analyze the data collected. 

**Work Plan**

The first step to creating this project will be to gather data by locating all of the covers of Vogue. This step will probably be the most time consuming. There are many online resources, as well as archives of the Vogue covers that we will need to gain access to. This will be done mostly by the students, as it will be a good learning experience for them and they will earn credit; thus, we do not need to pay a staff member to complete this. This work that they complete will be diligently checked by myself. 

The next step of this project will be to create a topic model. This step will probably take around two weeks to complete all of the models. Each of the countries will be topic modeled each year, and put together in a visualization. Following having the basic visualization completed by Mallet, we will start adding titles and cleaning up the data. We will then use an algorithm found online to create the topic model over time, and work with the University computer department to create a more user friendly website format. As someone who is familiar with website design, I will work to make it as simple and interactive as possible while still portraying the data accurately. 

Following this, we will work to analyze the data. This will be a large part of my responsibility as well as recruiting other professors and scholars to add their input. I would like some students who are very interested in the project to take part in the analysis as I think it is important to get a number of different opinions regarding the data as data is subjective. Once the data is analyzed, it will also be imported into the website in a user friendly matter. This will create the entire project online. 

The evaluation of the project will be widespread. In addition to receiving reviews from the University of Richmond campus, I would like to distribute the project website to a number of different college campuses for both scholars and students to examine. I would like feedback from both the scholars on how clear the data/analysis is; as well as, from the students regarding how comprehensive the site is. A major goal of this project is to address both people from an academic audience, as well as to the general public. 


**Staff**

As listed in the “Participants” section of this paper, the researchers involved in the project will be myself, Dr. Lauren Tilton, Lindsay King, Peter Leonard, and other students at the University of Richmond. 

Dr. Lauren Tilton is a professor of digital humanities at the University of Richmond, and is very familiar with the grant process. She has assisted and will continue to assist with this grant as we move through the process.

Lindsay King is the Associate Director for Access and Research Services at Yale University. She was on the staff of “Robots Reading Vogue.” She is familiar with the humanities questions presented in this project, and will be able to analyze the data. She also will be helpful to the students who are assigning in the project. 

Peter Leonard is a researcher at Yale University. He was a Fulbright Scholar and did a text mine research project supported by Google. His background with text mining and dealing with large potion of data will be helpful in the analysis portion of the process, but more so in collecting the data. 

A class of senior students at the University of Richmond will also assist gathering data for this project. This is an important learning experience for Digital Humanities scholars, and it will also help further engage the DH community at the University. Additionally, doing this will give the project adequate access to facilities. 

**Final Product and Dissemination**

Considering the popular and widely spoken about topic this project revolves around, I believe it will be relatively easy to distribute the project. Many college campuses would benefit from using the data in classes, as well as for students suffering from mental illness. In class, it could be used to teach students about data collecting or topic modeling. It could be used in psychology classes as the basis for a further study. In counseling centers, counselors could use the data to help identify societal issues with their patients. Another up and coming way of spreading research is through webinars. There is a large online community of bloggers who speak very openly about their mental illness, and how the media effects them. I think it would be interesting to have one of these bloggers use the data in a webinar. This would allow it to become far more accessible to a younger audience who are perhaps getting swept into the standards from magazines. 

The limitations of this project include a language barrier considering it is working with text from a number of different countries. At first, I would like to translate all of the writing into english, simply because the project is being done in the states. Depending on its success, it would be a long term goal to have a translator from each country address the translation as accurate or not. There are many phrases from other countries that do not exist in the english language, so it would be important to speak with a professional from each country to truly understand the meaning. 

Finally, as stated before, this project will be key in creating additional studies. It will be open to the public so that researchers from all over the world can use the data in their projects. I believe this is an incredibly important topic to gather more concrete and conclusion information about as to better understand how the advertising world effects consumers.
