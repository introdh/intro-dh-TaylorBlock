## **2) Abstract**
For this project, I will examine the covers of Vogue Magazine over the past ten years from all 17 countries that it is published including: Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and United States. The project data will be the text content featured on the cover. Using this data, a topic model will be created that highlights the key topics from each country over time. This will allow for analysis of the content per country, as well as over time. 

The purpose of the project is to provide an outline of the key topics discussed in Vogue Magazine over time. Being a well known fashion magazine, Vogue reaches a massive audience across the world. This topic model will help the public understand the cultural, societal, and beauty standards across 17 countries. The project will also provide insight into the consumer language used to entice women to purchase the product. I predict that across the world we will see different popular standards for women relating to sex, relationships, beauty and physique. I predict there will be altering levels of these topics based on the countries cultural values. 

An important component of this project will be creating a website entirely open to the public. This will allow for the general public to gain further knowledge regarding societal pressures on women. Additionally, scholars will be able to access the data to further contribute to their research and studies. There are a number of potential studies that could derive from this data set including: psychological studies, consumer advertising studies, as well as further digital humanities studies.

**History of the Project**

The idea for this project was conceived out of a need for more conclusive and public data. After viewing a few projects including, Robots Reading Vogue, it was obvious that while there is interest in this topic, there is not much clear data. There are bits and pieces filled in through analysis of the cover photos, but the algorithm used had noticeable problems which tainted the data. The data that is accessible does not offer any answers to humanities questions, rather just an image of the data collected. Thus, this project will not only create data, but it will also apply the information in an analysis so it can be understood by the public. In order for this project to be meaningful, there needs to be more context than what has been provided in earlier projects. 

While the work and data collecting has not yet started for this project, there are many preliminary aspects that have begun. As stated earlier, this project will partner with the University of Richmond for the facilities needed to complete the data. We have created a group of students who are interested in collecting and analyzing data for this project. They will do this for internship college credit, thus they do not need to be paid. Additionally, while making this a class at the university the facilities will not need to be paid for by the project. Therefore, we can use the money granted to other aspects of the project like hiring experts to help analyze the data collected.
