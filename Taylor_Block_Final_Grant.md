## **2) Abstract**
For this project, I will examine the covers of Vogue Magazine over the past ten years from all 17 countries that it is published including: Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and United States. The project data will be the text content featured on the cover. Using this data, a topic model will be created that highlights the key topics from each country over time. This will allow for analysis of the content per country, as well as over time. 

The purpose of the project is to provide an outline of the key topics discussed in Vogue Magazine over time. Being a well known fashion magazine, Vogue reaches a massive audience across the world. This topic model will help the public understand the cultural, societal, and beauty standards across 17 countries. The project will also provide insight into the consumer language used to entice women to purchase the product. I predict that across the world we will see different popular standards for women relating to sex, relationships, beauty and physique. I predict there will be altering levels of these topics based on the countries cultural values. 

An important component of this project will be creating a website entirely open to the public. This will allow for the general public to gain further knowledge regarding societal pressures on women. Additionally, scholars will be able to access the data to further contribute to their research and studies. There are a number of potential studies that could derive from this data set including: psychological studies, consumer advertising studies, as well as further digital humanities studies. 

## **3) Narrative**

**Inhancing the Humanities**
The overall goal of this project is to create a functional topic model that identifies prominent topics from Vogue Magazine over 10 years. With this project will we be able to identify the beauty standards across the world in order to better understand the cultural and societal pressures on women. By using the text on the magazine covers, we can identify the topics within these phrases that the industry is using to draw consumers to their product; as well as, identify the ideas that Vogue believes are most appealing to their audience. 

Why is this important? Over the past 10 years there as been an intense increase in mental health problems among young women. These illnesses have included depression, anxiety as well as eating disorders. Many physiologists and scholars in the humanities attribute this to the increase in digital media, and the consumer culture we live in today. Although some studies have been done, they are not conclusive as the data has not been examined as a whole. I want to create this database in order to gather all of this information into one location.	

The first steps of this project will be to gather the data of all of these covers. There are a number of online resources, as well as libraries that hold a vast collection of Vogue, it will just be a matter of complying this information. This could be a goal of the class from the University of Richmond that this project is planning on patterning with. Following data collection, Mallet will be used to create a visual topic model of the information. 

Upon concluded the research and topic modeling aspect of this project, the data will be thoroughly analyzed. A website will be used to host the data and analysis. The data will be displayed in interactive timelines from each country throughout time. Viewers will be able to interact with the images by selecting topics and seeing through images exactly what it is referring to. The website will be entirely open to the public, so that more people can understand and benefit from this project. 

Using this website, scholars can conduct further studies in order to truly pin point exactly what is having a negative effect on young women. With the results, there can be a concrete topic or ideal that we can identify as negatively effecting young women. Once this is known and proven, it will be significantly easier to change the industry. Rather than just saying, “Hey you shouldn’t do that,” we can conclude that the industry should not participate in including certain ideals because they are harmful for X reason that comes out of the topic model. The general public will benefit greatly from 

This topic model will allow scholars access to more data to complete further research. Students will benefit from the learning experience of creating the topic model, as well as using the results to analyze information and indicate where change needs to be made. This topic model as it will be easily accessible to the public, and well explained in the website created so that they may understand the standards employed by Vogue Magazine. 

The digital humanities questions that will be addressed in this project are:

+ How are beauty standards represented in text?
+ How do these standards vary per country?
+ What do these beauty standards say about society around the world?
+ How do these standards effect the population?

These questions will help further the media studies discipline within humanities. Media studies is defined as “the study of newspapers, magazines, advertising, etc. and their influence on society as an educational subject”. This project will help further media studies as it will examine the ideals and standards behind the content. With this topic model we will be able to understand what society deems as important through the covers of the magazines.

As I stated before, the project will be a topic model made through Mallet. A topic model is a computer-generated document that suggests themes and ideas that appear from co-ocurance which is how often certain words appear next to each other. For this model, 50 topics will be used. This is because there are not many words on the cover of the magazine, so 50 will allow for analysis without making it too large. This will create a topic model that provides an accurate representation of the topics covered on the covers. In addition, the topic model will include a timeline so the data will evolve year to year, helping identify the most prominent topics per year.

**History of the Project**

The idea for this project was conceived out of a need for more conclusive and public data. After viewing a few projects including, Robots Reading Vogue, it was obvious that while there is interest in this topic, there is not much clear data. There are bits and pieces filled in through analysis of the cover photos, but the algorithm used had noticeable problems which tainted the data. The data that is accessible does not offer any answers to humanities questions, rather just an image of the data collected. Thus, this project will not only create data, but it will also apply the information in an analysis so it can be understood by the public. In order for this project to be meaningful, there needs to be more context than what has been provided in earlier projects. 

While the work and data collecting has not yet started for this project, there are many preliminary aspects that have begun. As stated earlier, this project will partner with the University of Richmond for the facilities needed to complete the data. We have created a group of students who are interested in collecting and analyzing data for this project. They will do this for internship college credit, thus they do not need to be paid. Additionally, while making this a class at the university the facilities will not need to be paid for by the project. Therefore, we can use the money granted to other aspects of the project like hiring experts to help analyze the data collected. 

**Work Plan**
The first step to creating this project will be to gather data by locating all of the covers of Vogue. This step will probably be the most time consuming. There are many online resources, as well as archives of the Vogue covers that we will need to gain access to. This will be done mostly by the students, as it will be a good learning experience for them and they will earn credit; thus, we do not need to pay a staff member to complete this. This work that they complete will be diligently checked by myself. 

The next step of this project will be to create a topic model. This step will probably take around two weeks to complete all of the models. Each of the countries will be topic modeled each year, and put together in a visualization. Following having the basic visualization completed by Mallet, we will start adding titles and cleaning up the data. We will then use an algorithm found online to create the topic model over time, and work with the University computer department to create a more user friendly website format. As someone who is familiar with website design, I will work to make it as simple and interactive as possible while still portraying the data accurately. 

Following this, we will work to analyze the data. This will be a large part of my responsibility as well as recruiting other professors and scholars to add their input. I would like some students who are very interested in the project to take part in the analysis as I think it is important to get a number of different opinions regarding the data as data is subjective. Once the data is analyzed, it will also be imported into the website in a user friendly matter. This will create the entire project online. 

The evaluation of the project will be widespread. In addition to receiving reviews from the University of Richmond campus, I would like to distribute the project website to a number of different college campuses for both scholars and students to examine. I would like feedback from both the scholars on how clear the data/analysis is; as well as, from the students regarding how comprehensive the site is. A major goal of this project is to address both people from an academic audience, as well as to the general public. 


**Staff**
As listed in the “Participants” section of this paper, the researchers involved in the project will be myself, Dr. Lauren Tilton, Lindsay King, Peter Leonard, and other students at the University of Richmond. 

Dr. Lauren Tilton is a professor of digital humanities at the University of Richmond, and is very familiar with the grant process. She has assisted and will continue to assist with this grant as we move through the process.

Lindsay King is the Associate Director for Access and Research Services at Yale University. She was on the staff of “Robots Reading Vogue.” She is familiar with the humanities questions presented in this project, and will be able to analyze the data. She also will be helpful to the students who are assigning in the project. 

Peter Leonard is a researcher at Yale University. He was a Fulbright Scholar and did a text mine research project supported by Google. His background with text mining and dealing with large potion of data will be helpful in the analysis portion of the process, but more so in collecting the data. 

A class of senior students at the University of Richmond will also assist gathering data for this project. This is an important learning experience for Digital Humanities scholars, and it will also help further engage the DH community at the University. Additionally, doing this will give the project adequate access to facilities.
