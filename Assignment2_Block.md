## **Part Two: Analysis** 
For this assignment, the journal I chose is the Journal of Advertising. After college, I am very interested in pursuing a career in marketing and thought this would be of interest to my career path. The Journal of Advertising is a quarterly published academic journal that is peer-reviewed. It is owned by the American Academy of Advertising. For my data set, I chose to use the years 1996-2009. Over this time period, there has be dramatic changes in advertising efforts and I was interested to see if ideas and language has shifted or if there are similar consistent theories. 
	
For this project, I ended up sticking with the 25 topics. I actually had gone through and reduced the topic number to 15. However, when I did this I thought I lost a fair amount of data. Based on the 25 topics I have now, there is limited over lap and each topic does distinctly represent a different idea. I believe this is because advertising is a practice that is ever-changing. As soon as a new technology comes out, advertising shifts to take advantage of the access to consumers. I have been a marketing intern and worked as a Marketing Manager this past summer, and I recall a week where Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram all changed their policies and interfaces to better support businesses. That goes to show that advertising strategies can really adapt and change week to week sometimes. Therefore, I wanted to keep my list of topics at 25 so I could get a broader sense of the different prevalent topics throughout my time period. 
 
To be frank, I found this assignment to be very interesting. Be able to see precisely what language and ideas are important is advertising is fascinating to me. I saw my topic model as an accurate a broad image of all aspects of advertising. From branding to using humor in advertisements, a number of ideas were covered. Specifically, I found two topics to be very interesting: Creative Marketing and Digital Marketing. Prior to doing this research, I assumed based on my own life that these two forms of advertising were relatively new, perhaps they emerged in 2010. However, based on this model I was quite wrong. In order for these two topics to be considered a topic, they must have been written about a large amount in a short period of time. This goes to support my thought about new technology constantly shifting the advertising world.
	
Another interesting portion of this assignment was topic on gender in the media. This topic in particular had a fair amount of dates in the frequently used words. Before I attempted to change that, I did some research for the dates to see if they were at all meaningful. It turns out, majority of the dates are based on important studies that were published. For example, one of the frequently used terms was “1994”. After completing some research, I discovered that the article “Gendered Media: The Influence of Media on Views of Gender” was published by Julia T. Wood. This article divulges into topics of sexism being portrayed in the media, women being inaccurately and unfairly represented, and the under-represented groups of women. I had never really considered how a date could impact this kind of topic modeling, so it was really interesting to see how frequently dates of crucial events are used in the industry. 
	
One particular short coming could be the “intrusion” of a word in a topic that it does not belong in. Signs at 40 stated,  “The ‘intrusion’ of a word into a topic where it seems out of place. This has the result of linking articles in which that intrusive word is prominent with a topic in a potentially misleading way.”  (Goldstone et al., Signs at 40, 2014) For a topic like advertising I think that this is entirely possible considering that key words are used in a number of different ways. For example, I found the term “research” appeared in a number of different topics. I suppose it is possible for research to be correlated; however, it seems more likely in a few cases that it is an intrusive word. I find that there are a number of different possibilities with this topic model. In particular, I would love to create a model over time, similar to the one that is on Signs at 40. This would give an excellent perception of the changes that have occurred in the industry. Overall, I found this assignment to be incredibly interesting, and it helped me further understand how topic models work and why they are important.
