# Grant Workshop


## Question/ Abstract

Here in your repository, write your answers to the following: 

(1) Formulate the humanities question(s) guiding the project. 

Discuss the popular topics on Vogue Magazines cover from the past five years through topic modeling. This project will analyze how social standards for women vary per country. This will be done per country in order to analyze the differences across the world including: Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and United States.

(2) Provide a one-paragraph abstract written for a nonspecialist audience, clearly explaining the projectâ€™s principal activities and its expected results.

For this project, I would like to examine Vogue Magazine covers over the past 10 years from 17 different countries. This will be done to analyze the cultural norms and standards for women in each country. This project will require a database of the text on each Vogue cover from the past five years. To analyze the covers I will use topic modeling to discover which topics have been the most relevant per country. 

The characterstics of a strong abstract:

- explains the humanities question(s) guiding the project
- includes the DH methods that will be used and why
- identifies which humanities fields/ disciplines the project is engaged in
